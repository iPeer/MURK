Whether you attack or not, monsters will still attack you, and won't stop until they're dead or you run. Unless, of course, you make the first move.

Stealth Suits will make you less likely to be caught stealing from vendors.
Trader Suits will lower the cost of items bought from traders by certain ammounts, said ammounts will differ from suit to suit.
If you're in combat, vendors will patiently wait until you're done to ask you to trade with them.
Vendors have other places to be, if you take too long to respond to a trade request, they'll move on and you'll need to wait for the next one.
Vendors can take anything from 30 minutes to an hour to do a cycle of the game world.
If you're caught stealing from a vendor, not only will that vendor attack you, but your cycles' timer will be reset.
